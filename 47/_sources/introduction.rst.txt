.. note::
   `Demes` is a work-in-progress, as is its documentation. If you find an error
   in the documentation or a bug in the software, or would like to help, please
   head to `Github <https://github.com/grahamgower/demes>`_ to open an issue or
   start a pull request.

Welcome to the documentation for ``Demes``, a package for defining, parsing, and
sharing demographic models for population genetic simulations.

Motivation
----------

Simulation is central to population genetics studies, and there are many great
software out there for simulating sequencing data or computing expectations of
diversity statistics under a wide range of demographic scenarios. This requires
writing a formal description of the demographic model. Generally, each
simulation software has its own syntax and style for defining the demography -
learning curves for new software can be steep and mistakes are easy to make,
especially for complex demographic scenarios.

``Demes`` aims to make defining demographic models more intuitive, less prone
to error or ambiguity, and interchangeable between simulation platforms.
Demographic models, which define populations, their properties, and
relationships between them, are written in `YAML <https://yaml.org/>`_. Models
are then human-readable, and they may also be parsed and passed to a simulation
engine that supports ``demes`` input.

Getting started
---------------

- To get ``demes`` up and running, see the
  :ref:`Installation section <sec_installation>`
- In the :ref:`Tutorial section <sec_tutorial>`, you can find an introduction
  to writing demographic models using YAML, along with some bite-sized examples
  (:ref:`demographic models in YAML <sec_tutorial_yaml_demography>`), 
  manipulating and working with demography objects within python
  (:ref:`Python API <sec_tutorial_python_api>`), and adding features and
  attributes to demographic models, populations, or population epochs
  (:ref:`deme attributes <sec_tutorial_attributes>`).
- For a gallery of demographic models defined using ``demes``, see
  :ref:`Examples <sec_examples>`.
