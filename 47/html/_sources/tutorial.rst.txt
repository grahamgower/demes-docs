Defining a demography in YAML

.. note::
   what is YAML? and why is it appropriate for this task?*

A demographic model description contains enough information about
the demes (or populations) present, their attributes and relationships,
and general demographic features (e.g. rate of self-fertilization) to
be able to unambiguously recreate and simulate under that demograhy.
Thus, a ``demes`` model contains "global" attributes, `demes`, and
migration rates and mass migration events between demes.

In addition to deme and migration descriptions, every demography
requires the following:
1. `description`: 
2. `time_units`: 
3. If `time_units` are not "generations", we also need to specify
