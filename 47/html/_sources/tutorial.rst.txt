Defining a demography in YAML
-----------------------------

.. note::
   *what is YAML? and why is it appropriate for this task?*

A demographic model description contains enough information about
the demes (or populations) present, their attributes and relationships,
and general demographic features (e.g. rate of self-fertilization) to
be able to unambiguously recreate and simulate under that demograhy.
Thus, a ``demes`` model contains "global" attributes, `demes`, and
migration rates and mass migration events between demes.

A minimal YAML description of a demography requires the following:

#.  `description`: A description or identification of the demographic model.
#. `time_units`: The time units for any demographic events.
#. `demes`: a list of (at least one) deme, which must include information
   about its initial size.

For example, the simplest demography of a single population of constant
size (*N_e* = 1,000) would be written as
