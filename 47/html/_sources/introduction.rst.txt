Introduction

.. note::
   `Demes` is a work-in-progress, as is its documentation. If you find an error
   in the documentation or a bug in the software, or would like to help, please
   head to `Github <https://github.com/grahamgower/demes>`_ to open an issue or
   start a pull request.

Welcome to the documentation for `Demes`, a package for defining, parsing, and
sharing demographic models for population genetic simulations.

Motivation
----------

Simulation is central to population genetics studies, and there are many great
software out there for simulting sequencing data or computing expectations of
diversity statistics under a wide range of demographic scenarios. This requires
specifying the demographic model we want to simulate under. Generally, each
simulation software has its own syntax and style for defining the demography -
learning curves for new software can be steep and mistakes are easy to make,
especially for complex demographic scenarios.

`Demes` aims to make defining demographic models more intuitive, less prone
to error or ambiguity, and interchangeable between simulation platforms.
Demographic models, which define populations, their properties, and
relationships between them, are written in `YAML <https://yaml.org/>`_. Models
are then human-readable, and they may also be parsed and passed to a simulation
engine that supports `demes` input.

Getting started
---------------

- installation
- point to tutorial (specifying demography in YAML, using the Python API, etc)
